What androids dream of. Web application that plays AI-generated music accompanied with a procedural animation.

## Components

### Music Generator - `/music-generator`

Docker container that generates music in a MIDI format.

### Server - `/server`

Docker container that serves the MIDIs generated by the music generator. Probably needs a simple API too.

### Website - `/website`

Web application that fetches MIDIs from the server and plays them. Procedural animation too.
